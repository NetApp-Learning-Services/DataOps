    "# Streaming Pytorch Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there are ways to stream weights from storage during inference without loading the entire model into memory at once using load_state_dict(). This approach can be particularly useful for very large models that exceed available RAM. One method to achieve this is by using memory-mapped files.\n",
    "Here's an explanation of how you might implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Memory-Mapped Files: Memory-mapped files allow you to map a file on disk directly to memory without loading it all at once. This is done using the mmap module in Python.\n",
    "* Custom Storage Format: You'd need to store your model weights in a format that allows for easy access to specific parts of the model. This often involves some form of sharding or chunking of the weights.\n",
    "* Custom PyTorch Module: You'd create a custom PyTorch module that overrides the default parameter loading behavior to fetch weights from the memory-mapped file as needed."
