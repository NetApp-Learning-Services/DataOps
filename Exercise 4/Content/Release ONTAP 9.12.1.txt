S3 object storage
Update
Description
Expanded support for S3 actions
The following Amazon S3 API actions are supported:
* CopyObject
* UploadPartCopy
* BucketPolicy�(GET, PUT, DELETE)

SAN
Increased maximum LUN size for AFF and FAS platforms
Beginning with ONTAP 9.12.1P2, the maximum supported LUN size on AFF and FAS platforms increased from 16 TB to 128 TB.
Increased NVMe limits
The NVMe protocol supports the following:
* 8K subsystems in a single storage VM and a single cluster
* 12 node clusters NVMe/FC supports 256 controllers per port and NVMe/TCP supports 2K controllers per node.
NVME/TCP support for secure authentication
Secure, unidirectional and bidirectional authentication between an NVMe host and controller is supported over NVMe/TCP using the DHHMAC-CHAP authentication protocol.
MetroCluster IP support for NVMe
The NVMe/FC protocol is supported on 4-node MetroCluster IP configurations.
Security
In October 2022, NetApp implemented changes to reject AutoSupport message transmissions that are not sent by either HTTPS with TLSv1.2 or secure SMTP. For more information, see�SU484: NetApp will reject AutoSupport messages transmitted with insufficient transport security.
Autonomous Ransomware Protection interoperability enhancements
Autonomous Ransomware Protection is available for these configurations:
* Volumes protected with SnapMirror
* SVMs protected with SnapMirror
* SVMs enabled for migration (SVM data mobility)
Multifactor authentication (MFA) support for SSH with FIDO2 and PIV (both used by Yubikey)
SSH MFA can use hardware-assisted public/private key exchange with username and password. Yubikey is a physical token device that is plugged into the SSH client to increase MFA security.
Tamper-proof logging
All ONTAP internal logs are tamperproof by default, ensuring that compromised administrator accounts cannot hide malicious actions.
TLS transport for events
EMS events can be sent to a remote syslog server using the TLS protocol, thereby enhancing protection over the wire for central external audit logging.

Storage efficiency
Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency
Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency is enabled by default on new AFF C250, AFF C400, AFF C800 platforms and volumes. TSSE is not enabled by default on existing volumes but can be enabled manually using the ONTAP CLI.
Increase in usable aggregate space
For All Flash FAS (AFF) and the FAS500f platforms, the WAFL reserve for aggregates greater than 30TB is reduced from 10% to 5%, resulting in increased usable space in the aggregate.
File System Analytics: Top directories by size
File System Analytics now identifies the directories in a volume that are consuming the most space.

Storage resource management enhancements
FlexGroup rebalancing
You can enable automatic nondisruptive FlexGroup volume rebalancing to redistribute files between FlexGroup constituents.

It's recommended that you do not use automatic FlexGroup rebalancing after a FlexVol to FlexGroup conversion. Instead, you can use the disruptive retroactive file move feature available in ONTAP 9.10.1 and later, by entering the�volume rebalance file-move�command. For more information and command syntax, see�the ONTAP Command Reference.
