Learn about the new capabilities available in ONTAP 9.10.1.  The release candidate version was made available on November 28, 2021. The general availability was made available on January 31, 2022.
The following features were announced with ONTAP 9.10.1:

Data protection
Set SnapLock retention period up to 100 years
In releases earlier than ONTAP 9.10.1, the maximum supported retention time is January 19, 2071. Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1 SnapLock Enterprise and Compliance support a retention time up to October 26, 3058 and a retention period up to 100 years. Older policies are automatically converted when you extend retention dates.
Ability to create SnapLock and non-SnapLock volumes on the same aggregate
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, SnapLock and non-SnapLock volumes can exist on the same aggregate, so it is no longer necessary to create a separate SnapLock aggregate for SnapLock volumes.
Consistency groups
Organize volumes and LUNs in consistency groups to manage data protection policies and ensure write-order fidelity of workloads spanning multiple storage volumes.
Archive backups with the public cloud
SnapMirror Cloud supports tiering of ONTAP backups to lower cost public cloud object storage classes in AWS and MS Azure for long-term retention.
AES support for secure Netlogon channel communication
If you connect to Windows domain controllers using the Netlogon authentication service, you can use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure channel communications.
Kerberos for SMB domain-tunnel authentication
Kerberos authentication is available for domain tunnel authentications for ONTAP management in addition to NTLM. This allows for more secure logins to the ONTAP CLI and System Manager GUI using Active Directory credentials.
Channel binding for increased LDAP communication security
LDAP channel binding is supported by default for both Active Directory and name services LDAP connections. This provides better protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

File access protocols
NFS over RDMA (NVIDIA only)
NFS over RDMA utilizes RDMA adapters, allowing data to be copied directly between storage system memory and host system memory, circumventing CPU interruptions and overhead. NFS over RDMA enables the use of NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage for GPU-accelerated workloads on hosts with supported NVIDIA GPUs.

MetroCluster
Configuration of layer 3 MetroCluster IP address in MetroCluster IP configurations
You can edit the MetroCluster IP address, netmask, and gateway for nodes in a layer 3 configuration.
Simplified controller upgrade of nodes in a MetroCluster FC configuration
The upgrade procedure for the upgrade process using switchover and switchback has been simplified.
To learn about platform and switch configuration enhancements for MetroCluster configurations, see theï¿½ONTAP 9 Release Notes.

Networking
RDMA cluster interconnect
With the A400 or ASA A400 storage system and an X1151A cluster NIC you can accelerate high-performance workloads in a multi-node cluster leveraging RDMA for intra-cluster traffic
Confirmation is required before setting status admin to down for a LIF in a system SVM
This protects you from accidentally taking down LIFs that are critical for proper cluster operation. If you have scripts that invoke this behavior at the CLI, you must update them to account for the confirmation step.
Automatic detection and repair recommendations for network wiring issues
When a port reachability issue is detected, ONTAP System Manager recommends a repair operation to resolve the issue.
Internet Protocol security (IPsec) certificates
IPsec policies support pre-shared keys (PSKs) in addition to certificates for authentication.
LIF service policies
Firewall policies are deprecated and replaced with LIF service policies. A new NTP LIF service policy has also been added to provide more control over which LIFs are used for outbound NTP requests.

S3 object storage
S3 object data protection, backup and disaster recovery
S3 SnapMirror provides data protection services for ONTAP S3 object storage, including buckets mirroring to ONTAP S3 configurations, and bucket backup to NetApp and non-NetApp destinations.
S3 audit
You can audit data and management events in ONTAP S3 environments. S3 audit functionality is similar to existing NAS auditing capabilities, and S3 and NAS auditing can coexist in a cluster.

SAN
NVMe namespace
You can use the ONTAP CLI to increase or decrease the size of a namespace. You can use System Manager to increase the size of a namespace.
NVMe protocol support for TCP
The non-volatile memory express (NVMe) protocol is available for SAN environments over an TCP network.

Security
Autonomous Ransomware Protection
Using workload analysis in NAS environments, Autonomous Ransomware Protection alerts you about abnormal activity that might indicate a ransomware attack. Autonomous Ransomware Protection also creates automatic Snapshot backups when an attack is detected, in addition to existing protection from scheduled Snapshot copies.
Encryption key management
Use Azure Key Vault and Google Cloud Platform Key Management Service to store, protect, and utilize ONTAP keys, streamlining key management and access.

Storage efficiency
Temperature-sensitive storage efficiency
You can enable temperature-sensitive storage efficiency using either "default" mode or "efficient" mode on new or existing AFF volumes.
Ability to non-disruptively move SVMs between clusters
You can relocate SVMs between physical AFF clusters, from a source to a destination, for load balancing, performance improvements, equipment upgrades, and data center migrations.

Storage resource management enhancements
Activity tracking for hot objects with File System Analytics (FSA)
To improve system performance assessment, FSA can identify hot objects: files, directories, users, and clients with the most traffic and throughput.
Global file-read locking
Enable a read lock from a single point across all caches and the origin; affected article in migration.
NFSv4 support for FlexCache
FlexCache volumes support NFSv4 protocol.
Create clones from existing FlexGroup volumes
You can create a FlexClone volume using existing FlexGroup volumes.
Convert a FlexVol volume to a FlexGroup in an SVM disaster recovery source
You can convert FlexVol volumes to FlexGroup volumes in an SVM disaster recovery source.

SVM management enhancements
Ability to nondisruptively move SVMs between clusters
You can relocate SVMs between physical AFF clusters, from a source to a destination, for load balancing, performance improvements, equipment upgrades, and data center migrations.

System Manager
Enable performance telemetry logging in System Manager logs
Administrators can enable telemetry logging if they experience performance issues with System Manager, and then contact support to analyze the issue.
NetApp License Files
All license keys are delivered as NetApp License Files instead of individual 28-character license keys, making it possible to license multiple features using one file.
Update firmware automatically
System Manager administrators can configure ONTAP to automatically update firmware.
Review risk mitigation recommendations and acknowledge the risks reported by Active IQ
System Manager users can view the risks reported by Active IQ and review recommendations about mitigating the risks. Beginning with 9.10.1, users can also acknowledge risks.
Configure administrator reception of EMS event notifications
System Manager administrators can configure how Event Management System (EMS) event notifications are delivered so they are notified of system issues that require their attention.
Manage certificates
System Manager administrators can manage trusted certificate authorities, client/server certificates, and local (onboard) certificate authorities.
Use System Manager to view historical use of capacity and to predict future capacity needs
Integration between Active IQ and System Manager allows administrators to view data about historical trends in capacity use for clusters.
Use System Manager to back up data to StorageGRID using the Cloud Backup Service
As a Cloud Backup Service administrator, you can back up to StorageGRID if you have Cloud Manager deployed on premises. You can also archive objects using Cloud Backup Service with AWS or Azure.
